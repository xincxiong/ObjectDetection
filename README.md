## YOLO is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time.

1. ** _fileter with a threshold on class scores_**

   The model gives you a total of 19x19x5x85 numbers, with each box described by 85 numbers. It'll be convenient to rearrange the (19,19,5,85) (or (19,19,425)) dimensional tensor into the following variables:

   - box_confidence: tensor of shape  (19×19,5,1)(19×19,5,1)  containing  pcpc  (confidence probability that there's some object) for each of the 5 boxes predicted in each of the 19x19 cells.
   - boxes: tensor of shape  (19×19,5,4)(19×19,5,4)  containing  (bx,by,bh,bw)(bx,by,bh,bw)  for each of the 5 boxes per cell.
   - box_class_probs: tensor of shape  (19×19,5,80)(19×19,5,80)  containing the detection probabilities  (c1,c2,...c80)(c1,c2,...c80)  for each of the 80 classes for each of the 5 boxes per cell.

    """Filters YOLO boxes by thresholding on object and class confidence.    
    Arguments:
    box_confidence -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 1)
    boxes -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 4)

    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), containing (b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w) coordinates of selected boxes
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), containing the index of the class detected by the selected boxes
    
    Note: "None" is here because you don't know the exact number of selected boxes, as it depends on the threshold.

    # Step 1: Compute box scores

 2. Non-max suppression
    Even after filtering by thresholding over the classes scores, you still end up a lot of overlapping boxes. A second filter for selecting the right boxes is called non-maximum suppression (NMS). 


'''

    K.get_session().run(tf.variables_initializer([max_boxes_tensor])) # initialize variable max_boxes_tensor
    
    # Use tf.image.non_max_suppression() to get the list of indices corresponding to boxes you keep
    nms_indices = tf.image.non_max_suppression(boxes, scores, max_boxes_tensor, iou_threshold=iou_threshold)   
    # Use K.gather() to select only nms_indices from scores, boxes and classes
    scores = K.gather(scores, nms_indices)
    boxes = K.gather(boxes, nms_indices)
    classes = K.gather(classes, nms_indices)
    
    
    return scores, boxes, classes

3. wrapping up the filtering 
 Implement yolo_eval() which takes the output of the YOLO encoding and filters the boxes using score threshold and NMS.
Converts the output of YOLO encoding (a lot of boxes) to your predicted boxes along with their scores, box coordinates and classes.
    
    Arguments:
    yolo_outputs -- output of the encoding model (for image_shape of (608, 608, 3)), contains 4 tensors:
                    box_confidence: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 1)
                    box_xy: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 2)
                    box_wh: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 2)
                    box_class_probs: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 80)
    image_shape -- tensor of shape (2,) containing the input shape, in this notebook we use (608., 608.) (has to be float32 dtype)
    max_boxes -- integer, maximum number of predicted boxes you'd like
    score_threshold -- real value, if [ highest class probability score < threshold], then get rid of the corresponding box
    iou_threshold -- real value, "intersection over union" threshold used for NMS filtering
    
    Returns:
    scores -- tensor of shape (None, ), predicted score for each box
    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), predicted box coordinates
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), predicted class for each box

- Input image (608, 608, 3)
- The input image goes through a CNN, resulting in a (19,19,5,85) dimensional output.
- After flattening the last two dimensions, the output is a volume of shape (19, 19, 425):
- Each cell in a 19x19 grid over the input image gives 425 numbers.
- 425 = 5 x 85 because each cell contains predictions for 5 boxes, corresponding to 5 anchor boxes, as seen in lecture.
- 85 = 5 + 80 where 5 is because  (pc,bx,by,bh,bw)(pc,bx,by,bh,bw)  has 5 numbers, and and 80 is the number of classes we'd like to detect
- You then select only few boxes based on:
- Score-thresholding: throw away boxes that have detected a class with a score less than the threshold
- Non-max suppression: Compute the Intersection over Union and avoid selecting overlapping boxes
- This gives you YOLO's final output.
